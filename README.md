This is copyright by @themodernhacker please use it lawfully. 

It's is my second python project A Port Scanner which is used to scan ports simply and easily.

All the instructions are given here, so read them carefully.

First, enter the target IP (target IP) then enter the starting port number (any number from where you want to start scanning) then enter the end port number (any number from where you want to end scanning).

Example- 192.168.1.1 1 100 ( 192.168.1.1 target IP, 1 Starting port number, 100 Ending port number).
